### Brief Non-Technical Description:
"I built an interactive CV chatbot that allows natural conversation about my professional background. Users can ask typical interview questions and get detailed, personalized responses about my experience, skills, and projects. It uses modern AI technology to provide an engaging alternative to reading a traditional CV."

### Technical Description:
"The application uses a modern full-stack architecture:
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI and LangChain for AI-powered conversations
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using my CV as a knowledge base
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS for a professional, responsive interface  
- **Deployment**: Configured for Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) with Docker support
- **Key Features**: Real-time chat, conversation memory, suggested questions, mobile-responsive design

This approach demonstrates practical AI application, modern web development skills, and production deployment capabilities."

## üé§ Demo Questions to Try:
- "What's your professional background?"
- "Tell me about your technical skills"
